## FIRST COMMENT (The Maker's Story)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Roy, and I built CR AudioViz AI with my wife Cindy because we were tired of the creative tool chaos.

**The Problem:**
Every creator I know juggles 5-10 different subscriptions. Different logins. Different interfaces. Credits that expire. Hidden fees. And if you make a mistake? Too bad.

**Our Solution:**
We built one platform where everything works together. Document creation, graphic design, audio/video tools, business automation—all powered by AI, all in one place.

**But here's what makes us different:**

✅ **Credits never expire** on paid plans. Use them when YOU need them.

✅ **Automatic error refunds.** AI made a mistake? We refund your credits automatically.

✅ **You own your code.** Take it anywhere. No lock-in.

✅ **Javari AI learns how YOU work.** It's not just a chatbot—it's your creative partner.

**We're also building 20 Social Impact Modules** for veterans, first responders, faith communities, and animal rescues. Because professional tools shouldn't just be for big companies.

We're a small team from Fort Myers, Florida. Self-funded. Revenue-focused. Building something we actually want to use.

Would love your feedback! Drop a comment or try it out at craudiovizai.com
